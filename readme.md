# Python Experiments for Semester 7

This repository contains the Python implementations for various data structures and algorithms as part of my Semester 7 coursework.

## Implementations

1. **Stack**:
   - Implemented using Python lists.
   - Provides standard stack operations such as `push`, `pop`, `peek`, and `is_empty`.

2. **Queue**:
   - Implemented using Python lists.
   - Provides standard queue operations such as `enqueue`, `dequeue`, `front`, and `is_empty`.

3. **Linked List** (to be implemented in the `linked-list-implementation` branch):
   - A singly linked list with operations such as `append`, `prepend`, `delete`, and `print_list`.

## Branches

- `main`: Contains the implementations for Stack and Queue.
- `linked-list-implementation`: A separate branch for implementing the linked list.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
